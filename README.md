# middle_system

this system has four parts:
1:get_stock_to_database(daily and financial inclued)
2:get_train_data_from_src_data
3:train_model
4:predict and get candidates symbols

here is the main idea: define growth with price change as well as just based on financial data(mainly about the income, balance-sheet, cashflow, dividends); 
forecast the finanacial data next season based on past daily and financial info

divi into the codes you will find corresponding codes, enjoy it!
